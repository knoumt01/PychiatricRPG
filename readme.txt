Matt Knouff, FINAL PROJECT for CSCI N 451

MK-RPG

This is an RPG created using python w/ pygame, a few different tilesets, and some custom artwork that I created in Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.  All of the maps and the user interfaces were created by hand using Adobe Photoshop and GIMP.  Damages are calculated through a random number generated by random.randrange multiplied by each individual's attack skill.

Much of the inspiration for this game came from my current job, working with seriously mentally ill adults in the community.

CONTROLS:
SPACEBAR = TALK
A = ATTACK
M = ACTION KEY
C = CONTINUE

Areas that need improvement:
- lack of AI
- lack of content (definitely not enough material for a full RPG game)
- better developed battle sequences
(i.e. adding a defense skill that counteracts attack skill)
